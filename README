################## DESCRIPTION ##################
LANGUAGE: javascript

This is the backend I built for a social media "twitter" like website called "Tuitter". 
The backend interacts with a MongoDB server to create, store, and manage data.
Backend features implemented include sending messages, posting "tuits",
storing likes, and bookmarks.

############## REQUIREMENTS ##################
1.) nodejs 
2.) typescript
3.) mongoose module for nodejs (npm install mongoose)
4.) express module for nodejs (npm install express)
5.) elastic beanstalk (eb) for aws
6.) Connection to the internet (needed to connect to MongoDB)

################# HOW TO RUN LOCALLY ####################
Note: I use intelliJ as my IDE and I use ubuntu
to execute commands, so I will provide instructions
on how to run the code using ubuntu and IntelliJ
but you can use your own environment and command
shell as long as you install the proper requirements
for them.

This server code was meant to run in conjuncion with 
my react (front end) code, which you can find here 
https://github.com/radil708/FSE22-A3-React.

0.) Install all requirements.
1.) Download this repo & my react repo
2.) You will NEED to set an environment variable, because I 
     am using security features via express module.
     -> Ex. if you are using ubuntu, run the cmd:
           "export SECRET=SunsetOnTheBeach" (without quotes)
2.) Open ubuntu and navigate to this repo.
    Run the command: npm run build
  -> This will run the back end server on port 4000
  -> Make sure there are no conflicts with port use
  -> You know it is working if you search for  
     localhost:4000 on the addressbar of any browser
     and you are greeted to a white page with the words
     "Welcome to Ramzi's Fall2022 SoftEng Home Page".
3.) Open a different ubuntu terminal window. Navigate
    to the react repo. Run the react repo with the command
    npm start.
4.) Tuitter will be opened in a new page 
    on your browser
