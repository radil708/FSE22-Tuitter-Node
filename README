################## DESCRIPTION ##################
LANGUAGE: javascript

This is the backend I built for a social media "twitter" like website called "Tuitter". 
The backend interacts with a MongoDB server to create, store, and manage data.
You can sign up for an account, post a tweet, and send messages
to other users.

############## REQUIREMENTS ##################
1.) nodejs 
2.) typescript
3.) mongoose module for nodejs (npm install mongoose)
4.) express module for nodejs (npm install express)
5.) elastic beanstalk (eb) for aws

################# HOW TO RUN LOCALLY ####################
This server code was meant to run in conjuntion with 
my react (front end) code, which you can find here 
https://github.com/radil708/FSE22-A3-React.

0.) Install all requirements.
1.) Download this repo & my react repo
2.) You will NEED to set an environment variable, because I 
     am using security features via express module.
     -> Ex. if you are using ubuntu, run the cmd:
           "export SECRET=SunsetOnTheBeach" (without quotes)
2.) Run the command: npm run build
  -> This will run the back end server on port 4000
  -> Make sure there are no conflicts with port use
  -> This will open a new page on your browser
3.) Run the react repo. 
4.) Tuitter will be opened in a new page 
    on your browser
