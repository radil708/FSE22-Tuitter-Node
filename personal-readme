Pre-requesites for developers
1.) node installed
2.) typescript installed
3.) npm install mongoose
4.) npm install express
5.) eb (elastic beanstalk) installed

6.) eb env variables for username and password to MongoAtlas DB have been set
ie..
eb setenv DB_CLUSTER_USERNAME=<username to MongoDB Atlas Cloud cluster specific username>
eb setenv DB_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=<password to MongoDB Atlas Cloud cluster specific password>
NOTE** make sure to wait until command is finished running before calling another command

if wanting to run local copy, I use linux and you can set env variables by
export DB_CLUSTER_USERNAME=<username to MongoDB Atlas Cloud cluster specific username>
export DB_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=<password to MongoDB Atlas Cloud cluster specific password>

you can recall this info in the server.ts or any .ts file using:
process.env.DB_CLUSTER_USERNAME
process.env.DB_CLUSTER_PASSWORD

To use jsdoc:
    jsdoc -r dist
